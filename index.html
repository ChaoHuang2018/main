<p>I'm a postdoc fellow in the <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/electrical-computer/">ECE department</a> at <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/">Northwestern University</a>, supervised by <a href="http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~qzhu/">Prof. Qi Zhu</a>. My research interests include design and verification of various cyber physical systems, e.g. hybrid systems, neural-network controlled systems.</p>
<p>Prior to Northwestern, I received my B.S. and PhD in mathematics and applied mathematics and computer science from <a href="https://www.nju.edu.cn/EN/">Nanjing University</a> respectively. I also visited the <a href="https://www.cs.aau.dk/">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.en.aau.dk/">Aalborg University</a> and was pleased to work with <a href="http://people.cs.aau.dk/~kgl/">Prof. Kim G.

<td align="left"><p>Learning-enabled systems have been receiving numerous attractions from both academia and industry due to promising applications. They often leverage machine learning techniques in their perception of the environment, and increasingly also in the consequent decision making process for planning, navigation, control, etc. With no doubt, safety is one of the key issues before such systems are applied in practice. In this project, we conduct research on safety verification and design of learning-enabled systems with respect to perception, adaptation and control. We also develop tools for demonstration. Details of this project can be found in the <a href="les-project.html">project page</a>.</p>

<td align="left"><p>Timing uncertainty is one major type of uncertainty during the operation of autonomous systems, i.e., how much time it takes for certain function to complete and whether that meets the deadline. We consider the <i>weakly-hard</i> systems, where deadline misses are allowed in a bounded manner. A common example is that such deadline misses are described by (m,K) constraints, which simply specifies that among any K consecutive executions, at most m instances can miss their execution deadlines.. One of the most important functional properties is safety. In our weakly-hard framework, we consider whether the system with (m,K) constraints will ever enter a pre-specified unsafe state set (see the figure below). We develop several approaches to formally verify the safety of weakly-hard systems. We also develop tools for demonstration. Details of this project can be found in the <a href="whs-project.html">project page</a>.</p>
