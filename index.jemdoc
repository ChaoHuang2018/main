Hi, welcome to my page!

I'm a postdoc fellow in the [https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/electrical-computer/ ECE department] at [https://www.northwestern.edu/ Northwestern University], supervised by [http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~qzhu/ Prof. Qi Zhu]. My research interests include design and verification of various cyber physical systems, e.g. hybrid systems, neural-network controlled systems.

Prior to Northwestern, I received my B.S. and PhD in mathematics and applied mathematics and computer science from [https://www.nju.edu.cn/EN/ Nanjing University] respectively. I also visited the [https://www.cs.aau.dk/ Department of Computer Science] at [https://www.en.aau.dk/ Aalborg University] and was pleased to work with [http://people.cs.aau.dk/~kgl/ Prof. Kim G. Larsen].

*My current postdoc contract will end on May 2021 and I am looking for a tenure-track faculty position. Please contact me if there is any open position in your university. Thanks!*
